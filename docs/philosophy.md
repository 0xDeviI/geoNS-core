# The Philosophy Behind geoNS

## Why geoNS Exists

### The Right to Know, The Right to Connect

In an age where access to information is both a human right and a cornerstone of modern society, internet accessibility has become a vital measure of digital freedom. geoNS was born from a deeply personal struggle: the reality of living under Iran's nationwide internet censorship apparatus, where connectivity is not just unreliable but weaponized as a tool of control.

Internet censorship is rarely binary or consistent. A service might be:
- Accessible in Tehran but blocked in Isfahan
- Available on one ISP but throttled on another
- Permitted in the morning but filtered by evening
- Allowed in residential areas but restricted near government buildings

Existing solutions fail to capture this geographic nuance. Traditional monitoring tools check connectivity from corporate servers or data centers - not from the devices of real users navigating real censorship. This creates a dangerous illusion of uniformity, masking the fractured reality of digital access.

## The Goals

### Mapping the Digital Frontier

1. **Geolocational Truth-Telling**  
   Create the world's most granular, user-sourced map of internet accessibility, where every data point is tied to:
   - Precise GPS coordinates (though uses fake distraction distances to protect users' safety)
   - Local timestamp
   - Network provider
   - Device type
   - Service-specific accessibility status

2. **Censorship Pattern Recognition**  
   Build machine-readable datasets to expose:
   - Regional filtering policies
   - ISP-specific restriction patterns
   - Temporal censorship cycles (e.g., election-period blackouts)

3. **Network Diagnostics for the People**  
   Empower users to:
   - Differentiate censorship from technical outages
   - Compare connectivity across providers/regions
   - Document restriction incidents with cryptographic proof
   - Generate shareable network health reports

4. **Reclaiming Public Infrastructure**  
   Advocate that internet accessibility data should be:
   - Treated as public utility metrics (like water/power availability)
   - Protected from corporate/governmental obfuscation
   - Used to hold infrastructure providers accountable

## Core Values

### Principles That Cannot Be Compromised

1. **Radical Transparency**  
   - All data collection methods documented
   - No black-box algorithms

2. **Open Source as Oxygen**  
   - Every component lives in public repositories
   - Community-driven protocol upgrades
   - Forkable architecture by design

3. **Software Freedom Guarantee**  
   - While using as non-profit, you're free to do whatever you want with the source code. Check out [LICENSE](/LICENSE) for more.
   - Zero telemetry
   - Tor-friendly protocol

4. **Unfiltered Speech**  
   - No content-based filtering
   - Resistance to legal takedown requests via decentralized storage
   - Pseudonymous participation allowed

## The Road Ahead

This project is more than a technical tool - it's a political statement. By transforming individual connectivity experiences into collective knowledge, we aim to:

1. Turn censorship from an invisible force into mappable terrain
2. Provide forensic evidence for digital rights advocacy
3. Create infrastructure for censorship circumvention tools
4. Preserve historic records of internet freedom violations

We invite developers, activists, and citizens worldwide to contribute to this living atlas of digital liberty. Together, we can ensure that the right to connect becomes measurable, defendable, and fundamentally undeniable.

*"What is measured cannot be easily denied. What is documented becomes harder to erase."*
